# Chatbot
- A contextual chatbot using PyTorch. 


## Simple chatbot implementation with PyTorch.
- This project should be easy to follow for beginners and provide a basic understanding of chatbots. That how chatbot works and which libraries we need for this project. 
- The implementation is straightforward with a Feed Forward Neural net with 2 hidden layers.
- Customization for your own use case is very easy. Just modify `intents.json` with possible patterns and responses and re-run the training.

Implementation is very easy. I have used here Conda environment.
